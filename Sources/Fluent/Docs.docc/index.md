# ``Fluent``

The Fluent package makes it easy to use FluentKit in Vapor applications by tying the FluentKit database abstraction layer into the Vapor application lifecycle. It also provides helpers for mapping FluentKit's models to Vapor's authentication APIs.

For more information, see the [Fluent documentation](https://docs.vapor.codes/fluent/overview/).
